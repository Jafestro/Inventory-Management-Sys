# 3. Development Methods
## 1. Methodology Used
We adopted the Agile methodology to ensure iterative development and regular feedback. We held daily (or every other day) Scrum meetings over Discord to review what we had accomplished in the previous day(s) and discuss our goals. During these meetings, we assessed whether we were on track to meet our objectives and ensured that we were heading in the right direction.

## 2. Phases of Development

### Planning
We gathered information about the functionalities and qualities needed for our application to achieve the goals and vision we had set.

### Design
We brainstormed how the application should look and function during each phase. For now, the first version of our application can be considered complete. In this phase, we also discussed the applicationâ€™s architecture, database design, and its localization implementation.

### Implementation
We began implementing the features and plans outlined during the planning and design phases.

### Testing
After the implementation phase (note that unit tests were written during implementation to test the core functionalities throughout), we conducted thorough testing of our application. This included both manual testing and tool-assisted testing. We performed various types of tests, such as regression, acceptance, load, stress, and end-to-end testing. During this phase, we welcomed a new team member, who contributed to accelerating the testing process.

## 3. Team Collaboration
We used a variety of tools to stay organized and on track as a team. Discord was our primary platform for daily meetings, where we discussed progress and planned the next steps. Additionally, we tracked our tasks using Trello, which made it easier to remember completed tasks, monitor ongoing ones, and plan future work.

## 4. Why This Method?
The Agile methodology allowed us to stay on track and up-to-date while enabling us to respond to changes quickly. This approach ensured we could adjust our processes whenever necessary.

### Class Diagram

![Class Diagram](Diagrams/LuokkaKaavio.png)

### Authentication Flow

**1. User Login**: The user logs in with their username and password.

- The system checks the credentials against the stored user data.

**2. User Register**

- The user enters first name, last name, username, password.

**3. Token Generation**: On successful login, a token is generated.

- This token is used for secure access to user-specific data.

**4. Token Validation**: For each subsequent request, the token is validated to ensure the user is authenticated.

- If the token is valid, the request is processed; otherwise, an authentication error is returned.

#### Key Classes:
- [LoginController](/src/main/java/com/reppuhallinta/inventory_management_sys/controller/LoginController.java): Handles user login requests.

## 6.2 Clean Code
### 1. Principles Applied  
We adhered to common programming conventions throughout the development process. This included writing meaningful names for variables, functions, and classes (e.g., `updateStock()` instead of `us()`). We also ensured that functions were designed to perform a single responsibility wherever possible (e.g., a function for "add inventory" only adds inventory and does not perform unrelated calculations).  

### 2. Consistency  
We followed the Google Java Style Guide wherever feasible. To ensure consistency, we used tools such as **Checkstyle**, **PMD**, **SpotBugs**, and **SonarLint** to check our code for adherence to coding standards.  

### 3. Commenting and Documentation  
We wrote proper comments where necessary and created detailed Javadoc for public methods and classes. Additionally, we prepared different types of documentation to clarify various aspects of the application. This included:  
   - **Software Design Documentation**  
   - **System Architecture Documentation**  
   - **Testing Strategy Documentation**  
   - **User Documentation**  

### 4. Error Handling  
We implemented error-handling mechanisms using `try-catch` blocks to print stack traces when errors occurred. Logging was also used to monitor application behavior and track errors. For front-end errors, we utilized `try-catch` blocks to handle issues and provided users with clear pop-up messages to notify them of incorrect actions or invalid inputs.  

### 5. Code Review and Refactoring  
We added a **CODEOWNERS** file to our GitHub repository and implemented a structured code review process. This included:  
   - Configuring restrictions to prevent direct pushes to the main branch.  
   - Requiring contributors to create new branches for changes and submit pull requests (PRs).  
   - Mandating that at least one code owner review and approve the PR before it could be rebased and merged into the main branch.  
Code reviews were performed for every PR to maintain clear, efficient, and high-quality code.  

### 6. Impact on Maintainability  
By following code conventions, using best practices, leveraging tools, and implementing thorough error handling and reviews, we ensured that the codebase remains easy to maintain and scalable for future development.  


# 7. Deployment Process
